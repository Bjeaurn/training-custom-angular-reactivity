Please **fork** the following link:
https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-klk8acnt?file=src%2FREQUIREMENTS.md

The stackblitz contains a "REQUIREMENTS.md" file that shows the current requirements that have been implemented in an imperative way. 
Implement the 2nd set of requirements.

Is it more useful to refactor to use signals? Why or why not?

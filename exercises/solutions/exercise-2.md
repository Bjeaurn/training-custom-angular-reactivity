Yes, signals do fix the problem. This is because they are directly tied to the change detection system and will actively notify that a component needs rechecking. The "glitch-free" nature of signals also prevents any clashing of values. Wonderful stuff and a nice exercise in getting familiar with signals and how to update its values.

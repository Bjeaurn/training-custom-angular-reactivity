        // Quick note: This is a simple HTML file that loads RxJS from a CDN. You can run this in your browser directly.
        // No stackblitz for these :).

        // Exercise 1;
        // Use range() to write your first Observable, and log its contents to your console
        // The line underneath loads the `range` function from RxJS into your browser.
        const { range } = rxjs;

        // Start here, have fun!
